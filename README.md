# üöÄ Project Setup Guide

This repository contains a **Dockerized backend application** with database services.  
Follow the steps below to get your environment up and running.

---

## 1. Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

---

## 2. Environment Variables

- Copy the provided example file:

  ```sh
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- Adjust values in .env if necessary (e.g. ports, DB name).

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit your .env file. Only .env.example is versioned.

### 3. Running the Project

Build and start all services:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Stop services without removing data:

```sh
docker compose down
```

Stop services and clean volumes (removes DB data):

```sh
docker compose down -v
```

### 4. Docker Notes

Docker ps should not list stray processes. After running docker compose down, the project should not leave containers running in the background.

To check:

```sh
docker ps
```

If no containers appear, the environment is clean.

### 5. Using Postman

We provide a Postman collection JSON file for easier testing.

1. Open Postman

2. Click Import ‚Üí Upload Files

3. Select the provided .postman_collection.json

4. The collection will appear in your workspace with predefined requests

- Make sure your .env and Docker services are running before testing.
- Update environment variables in Postman if your host/port differ from defaults.
